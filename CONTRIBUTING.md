# Contributing to rance

Help is very welcome. Project is new-born and thus simple. Workspace is divided in 4 parts:

* `cobbler` is to be the equivalent of /etc/ansible/cobbler.py (as a cargo feature maybe ?)
* `rance` is the main project. It will be equivalent of ansible, ansible-config, ansible-console, ansible-doc, ansible-galaxy, ansible-inventory, ansible-playbook, ansible-pool and ansible-vault
* `rance-connection` will be ansible-connection brother
* `rance-test` will be ansible-test twin

Nothing has been done yet on cobbler.

rance has seen a bit of work. CLI args are similar to the ansible one, management had to be taken care of. config files management has begun, but it still needs a bit of work.

Nothing has been done yet on rance-connection.

Nothing has been done yet on rance-test.

# Mentoring

There’s so few code lines for now that I don’t think mentoring is necessary, but if you need any, feel free to ask.

# Website

Nothing on that front yet, maybe one day.

# Gitter

If that project gains a bit of traction, I’ll probably open a gitter room.

# Code

Feel free to fork, and ask for PRs.

# Github

Config needs tweaking (issues labels etc).
